. Step to follow when a new library module version is created
    . files interested
        . <ModuleName>/ModuleName>.h
            . add the two following #define statement 
                #elif (<MODULE_NAME>_VER == 2)
  	            #include "v_<verions number>/<Module Name>.h"
        . <ModuleName>/ModuleName>Manager.h
            . idem as above
        . <ModuleName>/ModuleName>Tbl.h
            . idem as above
        . <ModuleName>/<version>/<ModuleName>VerChk.h
            . Update version: it must be equal directory version
        . CMakeLists.txt
            . sections interested
                . set(CODE_FILES_LIB_<MODLULE_NAME>
                    . update directory where are located the .cpp files
                . add_executable(${EXECUTABLE}
                    . make you sure that the previous definition "CODE_FILES_LIB_<MODLULE_NAME>" is present in the list
                . target_compile_options(${EXECUTABLE} PRIVATE
                    . update the version number
                        .     -D<MODLULE_NAME>_VER=<version number>

. Step to follow when a library module version is changed
    . see the prevoius instruction about
        . CMakeLists.txt
    . only CMakeLists.txt must be update 
    . the other files are already OK
